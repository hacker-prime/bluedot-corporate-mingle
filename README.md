# bluedot-corporate-mingle
The website was built in preparation for a corporate mingle the company had/was planning. It was based off a design approved by management.
The design provided can be found at the following link:https://www.behance.net/gallery/103814431/Landing-page-design.
The primary requirement was to replicate the top part of the design that has the sloping bottom/base, the rada/spy chart to the right
and the background image and the background color gradient.I improved upon the design  by taking the static radar chart and making it dynamic 
by constantly updating the values. I utilized https://www.chartjs.org/ for the radar chart.The website also has database operations so to store information of users so that one or a few could be given a prize of a free research study.
