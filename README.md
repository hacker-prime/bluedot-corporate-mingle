# bluedot-corporate-mingle
The website was built in preparation for a corporate mingle the company had/was planning. It was based off a design approved by management.
The design provided can be found at the following link:https://www.behance.net/gallery/103814431/Landing-page-design.
The primary requirement was to replicate the top part of the design that has the sloping bottom/base, the rada/spy chart to the right
and the background image and the background color gradient.
The website also has database operations so to store information of users so that one or a few could be given a prize of a free research study.
